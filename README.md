<h2>What is a Math Puzzle in CICS?</h2>
<p>To me,  Math Puzzle is a logic puzzle that can be solved using simple pattern recognition and combining it with math in order to determine a solution without actually solving out the puzzle. For example, it might involve figuring out how many possible ways there are to achieve something but rather than testing every possible solution to see if it works, you might identify a pattern in the solutions and just use math to figure out the maximum number of working solutions.</p>
<h2>A Puzzle I Like</h2>
<p>I like the puzzle in which you have to swap the places of knights in chess within a 3x3 square, with black knights on one side and white knights on the other. I think it encompasses what makes Math Puzzles so interesting, that being noticing patterns or breaking down a solution into repeated steps. In this case that means essentially rotating the positions of the pieces 90 degrees twice, rather than 180 degrees once.</p>
