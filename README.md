<h2>What is a Math Puzzle in CICS?</h2>
<p>To me,  Math Puzzle is a logic puzzle that can be solved using simple pattern recognition and combining it with math in order to determine a solution without actually solving out the puzzle. For example, it might involve figuring out how many possible ways there are to achieve something but rather than testing every possible solution to see if it works, you might identify a pattern in the solutions and just use math to figure out the maximum number of working solutions.</p>
<h2>A Puzzle I Like</h2>
<p>I really like this puzzle: [What Is The Area Of This Infinitely Repeating Shape?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXl7zKoR8kk). While not the kind I'm good at, I think it encompasses what makes Math Puzzles so interesting, that being noticing patterns and using mathematical knowledge to find a solution without doing all the work.
